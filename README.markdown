## Download

For download, visit http://wbaddons.webbird.de/?do=item&item=3

## Please note

The vendors subdirectory is intentionally empty in the GitHub repository. So you
will have to add SecurImage v2.0.2 (http://phpcaptcha.org/) and class.upload.php
(http://verot.net) manually if you download wblib from GitHub. The wblib will
work without, but you will not be able to use the Captcha and Upload features
of wbFormBuilder.

## Important note for LEPTON/WB users!

Do NOT use the ZIP option provided by GitHub. This will give you an
incomplete download, and the ZIP will not be installable!
